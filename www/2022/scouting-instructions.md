Scouting Instructions
========================

## Scouting Instructions

Watch your robot and record its actions. Use the upward facing triangles to increase counters and the downward facing triangle to decrease them.

The game is played in three segments:

 - Autonomous -- The robot acts independently without input from human players.
 - TeleOp -- The robot is controlled via remote control.
 - End game -- The robot attempts to climb and hang from the bars.

When you are done use one of the buttons at the bottom to save the data. The biggest button is the suggested action and it will usually suggest scouting the next match.  If the data you scouted could be used for the next match, it will suggest uploading the data to the scouting hub. Plug into a cable from the scouting briefcase to before uploading data.
