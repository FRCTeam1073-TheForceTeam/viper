Event Creation by Data Entry Instructions
========================

## Creating an event with data entry

When you get to an event, you are often handed a paper with the event schedule on it. You can enter this data into the app to be able to scout the event.

### Tips

 - If you have internet access at the event, check to see if the schedule is up on the blue alliance website. If so, importing the data from there is a lot less work than typing it all in.
 - The software will attempt to generate an event ID for you based on the event name and starting date. So be sure to finalize the event name and dates before editing the ID.
 - Recommended: match the event ID to the event URL from www.thebluealliance.com
 - The year of the event will determine which game rules are used when scouting.
 - Team numbers must be digits only. If a team is entering two bots into an exhibition match, the second bot needs a separate number. Maybe try appending a "2" to the main team number like "1073" and "10732". You'll have to let scouters know about it.
 - The first time that you enter a team number, a button will get created for it. Simply press that button to enter that team number into other matches rather than typing the team number again and again.
 - The team slot with the yellow background is where team buttons will insert the team number.
 - Click on a team slot to focus the yellow background there.
 - It is possible to over-write a team number by focusing the yellow background on it and clicking a different team button.
 - If you are not planning to scout during practice matches, practice matches don't need to be entered. They are optional.
 - It is possible to start by entering just the practice matches then come back and add qualification matches later.
 - Don't forget to use the "Save Event" button when the data entry is done.
 - If want to edit the data, you can change it later.
   - From the event's page, under "Edit Event" click the "Practice and Qualification Matches" link.
   - You can also click the "Edit" link for the schedule CSV data to edit the data like a spreadsheet. Be more careful with that option because there is no data validation and the app may not work correctly if the data is not in the expected format.
