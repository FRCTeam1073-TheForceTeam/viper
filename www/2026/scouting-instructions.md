### Saving Your Data

Use one of the buttons at the bottom to save the data when you're done. The suggested button will be enlarged — usually this will be the button to progress to the next match, but in certain cases the app will recommend that you upload your data to the scouting hub. If you are not a wireless network, you will need to plug your device into the hub in order to upload your data.
