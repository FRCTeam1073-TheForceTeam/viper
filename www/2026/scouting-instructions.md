## Scouting Instructions

### Fuel Output

The biggest scouting task this year is counting fuel that the robot gets to its target.  Count any fuel that is

- shot
- placed
- pushed
- bulldozed

**Don't count** fuel that

- misses the target
- is shot into the hub when the hub is inactive

There are several possible targets for fuel:

- the hub (where it scores points when the hub is active)
- dumped on the floor in the alliance zone
- fed to the outpost
- moved (passed or pushed) from the neutral zone to the alliance zone
- moved (passed or pushed) from the opponent zone to the neutral zone
- passed from the opponent zone to the alliance zone

There are three buttons to count fuel. They are yellow (fuel colored) circles.

- 1 — when a robot that hits one fuel to the target
- 5 — when a robot hits five fuel to the target
- 10 — when a robot hits ten fuel to the target

### Tracking Zone and Target

As the robot moves between zone, press the arrows <img src="arrow-right.png" style="max-width:2em"> on the bumps and troughs to track which zone the robot moves to.

When the robot enters a zone, the most likely target for fuel will automatically get selected <img src="fuel-target-active.png" style="max-width:2em">:

- Alliance zone — the hub
- Neutral zone — alliance zone
- Opponent zone — alliance zone

Click on a different inactive target <img src="fuel-target.png" style="max-width:2em"> to activate it.


### Collection in Auto

In auto only, mark if the robot collects fuel from the Depot or the Outpost by clicking on the <img src="fuel-collect.png" style="max-width:2em"> icon. This is only a on/off to know if the robot collected there, you don't need to count the fuel collected.

### Climb Level

Click on the Tower for each level the robot climbs to record the climb level. If you click as the robot reaches a rung, we will get climb time information.

### Undoing Mistakes

There is an Undo button in both auto and tele that will allow you undo the last button pressed.

### End Game

At the end of the match, click to the end game tab and answer additional questions about how your robot performed in the match.

### Saving Your Data

Use one of the buttons at the bottom to save the data when you're done. The suggested button will be enlarged — usually this will be the button to progress to the next match, but in certain cases the app will recommend that you upload your data to the scouting hub. If you are not a wireless network, you will need to plug your device into the hub in order to upload your data.
