Scouting Bot Selection Instructions
========================

### Selecting a bot

You will be recording the actions of one of the six robots competing in each match. Each scouter collects data for a different bot. You need to choose a bot to scout based on its color (red vs blue) and its position in the schedule (1, 2, or 3). Your scouting device should be assigned to scout a particular position. The button for the position the device last scouted will be highlighted. If no button is highlighted, talk to the other scouters and work out which person will be scouting each position.

Once you have selected a position, you will continue to scout the same position in subsequent matches unless you and another scouter decide to switch.

Now that the page for selecting a bot is visible, you can unplug your phone, tablet, or laptop from the scouting briefcase. You won't need to plug back in until you're ready to upload data. Scouting data from several matches will be stored locally on your device until it is uploaded.
