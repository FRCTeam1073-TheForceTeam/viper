Scouting Bot Selection Instructions
========================

### Selecting a bot

You will be recording the actions of one of the robots competing in each match. Each scouter collects data for a different bot. You need to choose a bot to scout based on its color (red vs blue) and its position in the schedule. Your scouting device should be assigned to scout a particular color and position. The button for the bot last scouted will be highlighted. If no button is highlighted, talk to the other scouters and work out which person will be scouting each bot.

Once you have selected a bot, you will continue to scout bots with that color and position in subsequent matches unless you and another scouter decide to switch.

### Wired scouting

If you are using a wired cable to connect to a Viper server, you can disconnect the cable when the page for selecting a bot is visible. You won't need to plug back in until you're ready to upload data. Data from scouting several matches will be stored locally on your device until it is uploaded.
