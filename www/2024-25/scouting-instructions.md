Scouting Instructions
========================

## Scouting Instructions

Watch your robot and record its actions. Use the upward facing triangles to increase counters. If you make a mistake, use the undo button.

The game is played in two segments:

 - Autonomous — The robot acts independently without input from human players.
 - Teleoperated — The robot is controlled via remote control.

Autonomous and teleop have their own sections to record data, so make sure to switch between them when auto ends. The button at the bottom of the auto screen will start flashing as a reminder.

Record both the locations in which the robot collects objects and where it places them. Robots can only hold one game piece at a time, so you will be switching back and forth between recording collection and placement.

Use one of the buttons in the end section to save the data when you're done. The suggested button will be enlarged — usually this will be the button to progress to the next match, but in certain cases the app will recommend that you upload your data to the scouting hub. If you are using a wired connection, plug your device into the hub before uploading your data.
