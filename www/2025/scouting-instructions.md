## Scouting Instructions

Watch your robot and record its actions by clicking on the corresponding buttons. The icons used for actions are:

| | Collect | Remove<br>(without<br>collecting) | Drop<br>or Miss | Place<br>or Score |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Coral** | <img src=coral-collect.svg style=height:5em> | | <img src=coral-drop.svg style=height:5em> | <img src=coral-place.svg style=height:5em> |
| **Algae** | <img src=algae-collect.svg style=height:5em> | <img src=algae-remove.svg style=height:5em> | <img src=algae-drop.svg style=height:5em> | <img src=algae-place.svg style=height:5em> |

After your bot places algae into the processor, you are responsible for recording if the **opponent's human player** throws that algae into their barge net.

### Match Structure
Scouting each match is divided into four periods:
 - **Pre-match** — Before the match has started.
 - **Autonomous** — The robot acts independently without input from human players.
 - **Teleoperated** — The robot is controlled via remote control.
 - **End game** — The robot attempts climb on cages or park under the barge.

Be sure to switch to teleop when auto ends. Forgetting to move to teleop is a common scouting error. The button to proceed to teleop will start flashing <span style=color:red>red</span> and <span style=color:blue>blue</span> to remind you.

### Saving Your Data

Use one of the buttons at the bottom to save the data when you're done. The suggested button will be enlarged — usually this will be the button to progress to the next match, but in certain cases the app will recommend that you upload your data to the scouting hub. If you are not a wireless network, you will need to plug your device into the hub in order to upload your data.
