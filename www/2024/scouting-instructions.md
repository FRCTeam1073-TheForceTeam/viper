Scouting Instructions
========================

## Scouting Instructions

Watch your robot and record its actions. Use the upward facing triangles to increase counters and the downward facing triangle to decrease them.

The game is played in three segments:

 - Autonomous — The robot acts independently without input from human players.
 - Teleoperated — The robot is controlled via remote control.
 - End game — The robot attempts to climb onstage.

Autonomous and teleop have their own sections to record data, so make sure to switch between them when auto ends. Record both the locations in which the robot collects objects and where it places them.

Use one of the buttons at the bottom to save the data when you're done. The suggested button will be enlarged — usually this will be the button to progress to the next match, but in certain cases the app will recommend that you upload your data to the scouting hub. Plug your device into the hub in order to upload your data.
